* MiseEnPlace

This repo is a parent repo to install all MiseEnPlace configurations. Be warned
that this will override all configurations managed by MiseEnPlace and archive
any current configurations. Note that this is currently a linux only setup with
greatest support for Arch Linux. The intensions of this package are for me to be
able to install all of my configurations on a new system. You can install via
the AUR or simply run the following lines of code in your terminal to get
started:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordans1882/mise_en_place/master/mise_en_place-installer.sh
chmod +x mise_en_place-installer.sh
./mise_en_place-installer.sh
#+END_SRC
